Final product should enable command line interaction as such

(to compress file named "fileA" into a file named "fileA.cpr")
    $user ./prog -c fileA
(to decompress file named "fileA.cpr" into a file named "fileA")
    $user ./prog -d fileA.cpr

IDEA:

compression:
    1. Open file stream, while reading each byte, add frequency count to a freq array
    whose index corresponds to a specific char. Keep count of unique characters read.
    2. Sort this array.
    3. Create a node tree based on this sorted array and count. (this involves a priority queue)
    4. Again using an array of 256 elements, whose index corresponds to a char. This maps to the huffman code for that
    specific char.
    5. Rewind the original read file. Read one character from the file and ... jesus I give up
